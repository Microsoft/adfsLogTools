# AD FS Log Tools

## AdfsEventsModule Overview

This module provides tools for gathering related ADFS events from the security, admin, and debug logs, 
across multiple servers. This tool also allows the user to reconstruct the HTTP request/response headers 
from the logs.

## Cmdlets in AdfsEventsModule

This module exposes the following cmdlets: 

1. __```Get-AdfsEvents```__ - Allows you to query servers for ADFS logs. Contains options for querying, aggregation, and analysis

2. __```Write-ADFSEventsSummary```__ - Allows you to generate a summary of an ADFS request, based on the logs from ```Get-AdfsEvents```

3. __```Enable-ADFSAuditing```__ - Enables all the ADFS and OS auditing switches on the current server, and enables just the ADFS switches on remote servers

4. __```Disable-ADFSAuditing```__ - Disables all the ADFS and OS auditing switches on the current server, and disables just the ADFS switches on remote servers

The detailed parameters for __```Get-AdfsEvents```__ and __```Write-ADFSEventsSummary```__ are provided below.

The ```Get-AdfsEvents``` cmdlet is used to aggregate events by correlation ID, while the ```Write-ADFSEventsSummary```
cmdlet is used to generate a PowerShell Table of only the most relevant logging information from the events that are piped
in. 

## Get-AdfsEvents Parameters

* __Logs__ - A list of AD FS logs to include in the aggregation. Current options are: "Admin", "Debug", "Security".
The default will pull from both Security and Admin.
* __CorrelationID__ - The correlation ID for a single request. This will aggregate all chosen logs for this request  
* __All__ - This flag will cause all events in the desired logs to be grouped by correlation ID.
* __CreateAnalysisData__ - This flag can be combined with any means of event collection (a single Correlation ID, all events, or
time based) to reconstruct the HTTP requests that were performed for each Correlation ID. 
* __StartTime__ - The UTC start time to use when aggregating multiple requests. All requests that start after this 
time will be aggregated
* __EndTime__ - The UTC end time to use when aggregating multiple requests. All requests that end before this time
will be aggregated
* __Server__ - A comma-separated list of server names to pull logs from. On ADFS 2016 and up, you can use "\*" to query all
The default will query LocalHost
* __FilePath__ - A file path to an EVTX log file that you want to read from, instead of querying your servers

## Get-AdfsEvents Output

The output produced by Get-AdfsEvents is a list of objects, each containing the following properties. 

1.  __CorrelationID__ - the Correlation ID for this set of events
2.  __Events__ - a list of [EventLogRecord](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.eventing.reader.eventlogrecord)
objects for the matching Correlation ID. 
3.  __AnalysisData__ - a JSON data blob containing details on the HTTP requests that were performed during the course of this transaction
For more details on the AnalysisData blob, see below

## Using Get-AdfsEvents

1. Import the PowerShell Module 

    In a PowerShell window, run the following:

    ```ipmo AdfsEventsModule.psm1```

2. Run Get-AdfsEvents with your desired parameters to get a list of PowerShell objects

    EXAMPLE: Retrieve all logs from two servers for a specific request

    ```$logs = Get-AdfsEvents -Logs Security, Admin, Debug -CorrelationID 0c0fd6ee-4b1e-4260-0300-0080070000e3 -Server LocalHost, MyServer```

    OUTPUT:

    ```
    Events                              AnalysisData  CorrelationID
    ------                              -------       -------------

    {EventLogRecord, EventLogRecord}    {}            0c0fd6ee-4b1e-4260-0300-0080070000e3
    ```

3. To view specific records:

    ```$logs[0].Events[0]```

    OUTPUT:

    ```
    Message         : An HTTP request was received. See audit 510 with the same Instance ID for headers.

5. You can pipe the output of ```Write-ADFSEventsSummary``` to a CSV

    ```Get-AdfsEvents -Logs Security, Admin, Debug -CorrelationID 0c0fd6ee-4b1e-4260-0300-0080070000e3 -Server LocalHost, MyServer | Write-ADFSEventsSummary | Export-CSV mylogs.csv``` 


6. You can output the full data objects from ```Get-AdfsEvents``` to XML using:

    ```Export-Clixml``` 

    ```Import-Clixml``` 


## The AnalysisData Blob

The AnalysisData blob contains the following: 

* ```requests``` - a set of HTTP requests made during the current transaction. 
Each request contains request details, HTTP header information, and session token information (when available)

* ```responses``` - a set of HTTP responses given during the current transaction. 
Each response contains response details, HTTP header information, and outgoing tokens (when available)

* ```errors``` - a set of [EventLogRecord](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.eventing.reader.eventlogrecord) objects from 
the current transaction that are marked as errors

* ```timeline``` - a set of timeline events to show the progress of a transaction through the ADFS pipeline. 
  Timeline events correspond to roughly the following: 

    * ```incoming``` - ADFS received an incoming HTTP request 
    * ```authn``` - ADFS is performing authentication 
    * ```authz``` - ADFS is performing authorization checks 
    * ```issuance``` - ADFS is performing token issuance 

  Each timeline event contains a ```success``` or ```failure``` result, indicating whether the given pipeline step was a success or failure. 

## Pester Tests 

This project includes a set of [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) tests to ensure the basic functionality of the script. 

To run the tests, you must have Pester version 4.x or higher installed on the machine you will run ```Get-AdfsEvents``` from. 
For more information on installing Pester, see their [installation instructions](https://github.com/pester/Pester/wiki/Installation-and-Update). 

Once Pester is installed, you can copy the test file and script to the same location, and run the following: 

    cd <directory containing tests and script>
    Invoke-Pester -Script .\Test.AdfsEventsModule.ps1

For more details, see [the testing Readme](TESTDETAILS.md)
